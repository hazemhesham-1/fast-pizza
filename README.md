## üìã Overview

**Fast Pizza** is a Web Application built with Redux that allows users to order pizza quickly and easily ‚Äî no authentication required. Just pick your pizzas, fill in your details, and track your order from the restaurant to your doorstep.


## üîë Project Features

- **Mobile Responsive Design**
Optimized layout and interactions for all screen sizes (phones, tablets, and desktops).

- **Dynamic Pizza Menu**
The menu is loaded from an API, so it's always up to date.

- **No Account Required**
Users can place an order by simply entering their name, phone number, and address.

- **Shopping Cart**
Add one or more pizzas to the cart before checking out.

- **Priority Delivery Option**
Users can mark their order as "priority" for faster delivery (20% extra charge).

- **GPS Support**
Optionally include a GPS location to help the restaurant with delivery.

- **Track Your Order**
After placing an order, users receive a unique order ID they can use to track their order status.

- **Payment on Delivery**
No online payment is handled in-app ‚Äî users pay when the order is delivered.
